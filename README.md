# [IN PROGRESS]
# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the
computer will always either Win or Tie. You are given the option of being the
first player (X) or the second player (O). There is a score counter that
determines the current standings and you have the option to Undo a move or
Forfeit or Restart your game.

## How To Start
You must have Java installed on your machine. Once you have cloned the
repository, simply `cd TicTacToe/out/production/TicTacToe` and run
`java Controller.RunGame`. This will open a Java Swing UI with the Tic-Tac-Toe
game.
When starting the game, you are given the option of having two computer players,
 one computer player, or no computer players.
